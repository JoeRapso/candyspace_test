In total this took around 3-4 hours. About 1,5 hours was for the implementation and the rest was installing ReactJS, solving some dependency errors and cleaning the default react code you get when first installing as well as deploying the app to my host.

What I did first was look for a suitable bootstrap design and customize it for the needs of the app, after that I implemented the api request and logic for displaying the photos and loading spinner.

##
Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies and then npm start to run the app.
